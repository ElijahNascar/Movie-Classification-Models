# Movie-Classification-Models

Final Project for STAT 303-3. Full Report can be found in Krish'sFanClub_report.ipynb/html.

Traditionally, the decision-making process in the film industry has been heavily reliant on subjective judgments, making it inherently risky. However, the rise of big data and data science has the potential to revolutionize this approach. With the proliferation of digital platforms and online ticket sales, an enormous amount of data is generated, capturing various attributes of movies.

The primary objective of this project was to develop a model that could accurately determine whether a movie would generate revenue based on a variety of different attributes related to the movie itself. As part of this process in developing a predictive model, one secondary objective was to identify the factors that had the greatest impact on a movie generating revenue. By attaining both of these goals, recommendations could be made to major players in the film industry to improve decision making and movie selection.
