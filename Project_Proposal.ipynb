    "\n",
    "We think that movie studios would want to know in advance whether their movie would get a good rating or not. Since Rotten Tomatoes is one of the most well known sites for audiences to review and rate movies, we are going to build a model to predict whether a movie has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of “fresh” or “rotten.” Because movies are not rated “fresh” or “rotten” until after audience members have seen the movies, it would be useful for movie companies to be able to estimate their movies’ ratings before they are released to the public. The ratings of “fresh” and “rotten” are binary, so this is a classification problem. To optimize our model, we will focus on minimizing the false positives. It would be better to predict a fresh movie as rotten rather than a rotten movie as fresh because companies would not want to mess up the trustworthiness of fresh ratings. By optimizing the accuracy, we are reducing the risk that companies lose customers due to bad movies getting high ratings.\n",
